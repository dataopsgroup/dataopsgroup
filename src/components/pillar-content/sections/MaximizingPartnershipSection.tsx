      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Maximizing Your HubSpot Expert Partnership</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Once you've selected your HubSpot expert, the success of your project depends largely on how well you manage the partnership. The implementation phase is collaborative, and your internal preparation and engagement directly impact the outcomes you'll achieve.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Setting Up for Success</strong> starts with internal organization and clear communication frameworks. Designate a single project owner as your primary liaison with the expert. This person should have decision-making authority and enough bandwidth to be responsive throughout the implementation. Having multiple people trying to manage the relationship creates confusion and slows progress.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Ensure your key stakeholders have dedicated time for collaboration rather than trying to squeeze it into already packed schedules. HubSpot implementation isn't something that happens around you—it requires active participation from your team to ensure the configuration matches your actual business processes.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Prepare all necessary access credentials and permissions before the project starts. Create shared documentation for tracking progress and decisions. Set realistic expectations for internal team involvement, because your expert will need input, feedback, and testing from your team throughout the process.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Knowledge Transfer and Training Strategy</strong> should be ongoing rather than saved for the end of the project. Schedule training sessions throughout implementation so your team learns the system as it's being built. This approach helps identify potential issues early and ensures your team understands the reasoning behind configuration decisions.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Record all training sessions for future reference and for team members who might join later. Create role-specific training materials since different team members will use different aspects of HubSpot. Develop internal documentation that reflects your specific configuration and processes, not just generic HubSpot documentation.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Identify internal champions for different aspects of HubSpot—people who will become your go-to experts for marketing automation, sales processes, reporting, and other key areas. Plan for ongoing education beyond the initial implementation, including HubSpot certification and skill development for key team members.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Long-term Success and Optimization Planning</strong> extends beyond the initial implementation to ensure sustained value from your investment. Establish baseline metrics before implementation so you can measure actual improvement. Set up regular performance reviews and optimization sessions with your expert, even after the main implementation is complete.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Create automated reporting for key success metrics and plan quarterly strategy reviews to identify improvement opportunities. Monitor user adoption and engagement metrics to ensure your team is actually using the system effectively. Consider retainer arrangements for ongoing optimization, especially during the first year when you'll likely identify new opportunities and challenges.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Develop relationships with HubSpot support and resources for ongoing assistance with platform updates and new features. Create feedback loops for continuous improvement, and establish processes for making configuration changes without breaking existing functionality.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">The most successful HubSpot implementations are those where the expert partnership extends beyond the initial setup to ongoing optimization and strategic development. Your expert should become a trusted advisor who helps you adapt and grow your HubSpot usage as your business evolves.</p>
