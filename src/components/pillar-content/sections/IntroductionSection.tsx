      <p className="lead text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Your HubSpot subscription costs thousands annually, but that's just the beginning. The real investment‚Äîand the real risk‚Äîlies in who you choose to implement and optimize your system.
      </p>
      
      <p>After helping over 30 companies transform their HubSpot implementations since 2012, I've seen the stark difference between businesses that thrive with HubSpot and those that struggle. The differentiator isn't the platform‚Äîit's the expertise behind the strategy.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-800 mb-3">‚ö†Ô∏è The Hidden Cost of Wrong Decisions</h3>
        <p className="text-amber-700">
          A poorly chosen HubSpot expert can cost your business 6-12 months of lost momentum, $50,000+ in implementation costs, 
          and immeasurable opportunity cost from delayed growth initiatives. The right expert pays for themselves within 90 days.

      <h3>What Makes This Guide Different</h3>
      
      <p>
        Unlike generic hiring advice, this guide is written from the perspective of someone who has:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Implemented HubSpot for 30+ companies</strong> across industries from startups to Fortune 500</li>
        <li><strong>Rescued dozens of failed implementations</strong> from other agencies and consultants</li>
        <li><strong>Trained dozens of internal teams</strong> on HubSpot best practices</li>
        <li><strong>Maintained HubSpot certifications since 2012</strong> across all hubs and specializations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        This guide will save you from the most expensive mistakes I see businesses make when hiring HubSpot expertise.

      <h3>The Stakes: Why This Decision Matters</h3>
      
      <p>
        HubSpot implementations touch every aspect of your customer acquisition and retention process. 
        When done right, companies typically see:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>23% increase in lead conversion rates</strong> within the first quarter</li>
        <li><strong>35% reduction in sales cycle length</strong> through better lead scoring and nurturing</li>
        <li><strong>40% improvement in marketing ROI</strong> from proper attribution and optimization</li>
        <li><strong>60% increase in sales productivity</strong> through automated workflows and better data</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        When done wrong, businesses struggle with poor data quality, low adoption rates, and systems 
        that create more work instead of eliminating it.
