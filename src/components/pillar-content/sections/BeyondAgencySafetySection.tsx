      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Beyond the Agency Safety Net: Choosing Results Over Size</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">The traditional business mindset often equates larger teams with lower risk—the modern equivalent of "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM." However, today's competitive landscape rewards outcomes over organizational charts, and this is particularly true in the HubSpot ecosystem.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Why Direct Expertise Delivers Better Results</strong> comes down to several practical factors. When you work directly with an experienced HubSpot expert, you get continuity of knowledge throughout your project. The same person who analyzes your business requirements implements your solution, eliminating the knowledge transfer gaps that often occur in larger organizations.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Independent experts also tend to have deeper integration experience because they work across more diverse business environments. While agency team members might specialize in one industry or type of implementation, independent consultants typically see a wider variety of challenges and develop more creative solutions as a result.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">There's also the matter of business context. Experienced independent experts understand that technical implementation must align with business processes and goals. They're not just configuring software—they're solving business problems using HubSpot as the tool.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Critical Questions Beyond Company Size</strong> should focus on outcomes rather than infrastructure. Instead of asking "How big is your team?" ask questions like: "Who specifically will handle our HubSpot integrations, and what's their experience level?" or "How many businesses similar to ours have you helped with HubSpot implementations?"</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">You should also ask: "What specific integration challenges have you solved that are similar to our requirements?" and "How do you measure success, and what results should we expect to see?" These questions reveal whether someone truly understands how to deliver business value, not just technical functionality.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Don't forget to ask: "Are all team members direct employees, or do you use subcontractors for any work?" and "Where are your team members located, and will any work be performed offshore?" These questions can reveal hidden delivery models that might affect your project quality and communication.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Integration Expertise Advantage</strong> becomes clear when you consider a real example. A mid-sized SaaS company needed HubSpot implementation with integrations to Salesforce, Stripe, Intercom, and custom internal tools. They initially chose a well-known agency based on impressive sales presentations, but the work was assigned to junior developers unfamiliar with the business context. After six months and $45,000, they had multiple integration failures and minimal ROI.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">They then switched to an independent expert with proven SaaS integration experience. This expert directly assessed their business requirements and technical constraints, implemented working integrations in phases, and delivered positive ROI for $18,000 within four months. The key difference was that the independent expert understood both the technical requirements and business implications of each integration.</p>
