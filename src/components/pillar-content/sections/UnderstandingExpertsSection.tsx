      <p className="mb-4">The HubSpot ecosystem includes different types of professionals, and understanding these distinctions will help you make the right choice for your specific needs.</p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Independent HubSpot Experts</strong> work directly with you throughout your entire project. They typically have deep, hands-on experience with multiple HubSpot Hubs and integrations, often bringing 3+ years of intensive platform experience across various business types. What sets them apart is their combination of technical skills and business acumenâ€”they understand not just how to configure HubSpot, but why certain configurations make sense for your business goals.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">The biggest advantage of working with an independent expert is continuity. The person you meet during the sales process is the same person who will implement your solution and provide ongoing support. This eliminates the knowledge transfer gaps that often plague larger implementations.</p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>HubSpot Marketing Agencies</strong> operate quite differently. They're typically structured around account management, with senior staff handling sales conversations while junior team members often handle the actual implementation work. This isn't necessarily problematic, but it's important to understand the structure before you commit.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">Many agencies use standardized processes and templated approaches, which can be efficient but may not address your unique business requirements. They also have higher overhead costs that get reflected in their pricing, and some agencies actually outsource HubSpot work to subcontractors or offshore teams despite presenting themselves as having in-house expertise.</p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Experience Gap Reality</strong> is something many businesses don't consider until it's too late. You might be impressed by an agency's senior consultants during the sales process, only to discover that your day-to-day work will be handled by someone with much less experience. This is particularly problematic for complex integrations, where business context and technical expertise need to work together.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">The most successful HubSpot implementations typically come from working directly with experienced practitioners who understand both the platform's capabilities and your business challenges. When you're evaluating options, focus on who will actually be doing the work, not just who's making the sales presentation.</p>
