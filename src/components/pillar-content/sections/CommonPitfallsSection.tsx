      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Common Pitfalls When Hiring HubSpot Experts</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Learning from common mistakes can save you significant time, money, and frustration. These pitfalls represent the most frequent issues businesses encounter when selecting and working with HubSpot experts.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Safety Illusion</strong> represents one of the most costly mistakes businesses make. Many organizations default to choosing large agencies based on perceived safety rather than demonstrated expertise. This often stems from the outdated thinking that "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM," but in today's results-driven environment, this approach frequently backfires.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">The reality check you need is simple: ask specifically whether the people you're meeting with during the sales process will be directly involved in your implementation. Too often, businesses are impressed by senior consultants during presentations, only to discover their actual work will be handled by junior team members with limited experience.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Focus on evaluating the actual implementers rather than the sales team. The person configuring your workflows and building your integrations matters far more than the person who sold you the project.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Hidden Delivery Models</strong> create another significant risk that many businesses discover too late. Some agencies present themselves as having comprehensive in-house expertise while actually outsourcing HubSpot work to subcontractors or offshore teams. This isn't necessarily problematic if disclosed upfront, but it becomes an issue when it's hidden.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">The solution is direct questioning about delivery models. Ask whether all work will be performed by direct employees and where those employees are located. Request to meet all team members who will be directly involved in your implementation before signing any agreement.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Quality control becomes much more complex when multiple parties are involved in delivery. Communication can suffer when there are layers between you and the people doing the actual work. Understanding the delivery model upfront helps you set appropriate expectations and management approaches.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Misalignment of Expectations</strong> often occurs when businesses and experts haven't clearly defined success criteria and project scope. Assuming the expert understands unstated requirements leads to disappointment when the delivered solution doesn't match your vision.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Document detailed expectations and deliverables before starting work. This includes not just functional requirements, but also performance expectations, timeline assumptions, and success metrics. The more specific you can be upfront, the less likely you'll encounter surprises later.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Choosing Based on Price Alone</strong> represents a classic case of being penny-wise and pound-foolish. The lowest-cost option often becomes the most expensive when you factor in rework, extended timelines, and missed opportunities.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Balance cost considerations with experience and proven results. A more expensive expert who delivers faster implementation and better long-term results typically provides superior value to a cheaper option that requires extensive rework or delivers suboptimal configuration.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Insufficient Internal Commitment</strong> undermines even the best expert's efforts. Not allocating enough internal resources to support implementation virtually guarantees problems. Your expert needs input, feedback, and collaboration from your team throughout the process.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Ensure dedicated internal stakeholders have allocated time for the project rather than trying to fit it around their existing responsibilities. HubSpot implementation is not something that happens to your businessâ€”it requires active participation to be successful.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Skipping Due Diligence</strong> might seem like a time-saver, but it frequently leads to expensive mistakes. Failing to thoroughly check references and past work means you're making decisions based on presentations rather than proven performance.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Speak with multiple references and review detailed case studies. Ask specific questions about project outcomes, communication effectiveness, and whether they would hire the expert again. The extra time invested in due diligence pays for itself through better decision-making.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">The key to avoiding these pitfalls is maintaining focus on outcomes rather than process, asking direct questions about delivery models and team composition, and investing adequate time in evaluation rather than rushing to a decision based on initial impressions.</p>
