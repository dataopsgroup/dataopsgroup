      <p className="mb-4">Hiring the right HubSpot expert is one of the most important technology decisions you'll make for your business. The difference between a mediocre implementation and an exceptional one often comes down to the expertise, business acumen, and commitment of the person or team you choose to work with.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Focus on the Actual Implementers</strong> rather than being swayed by impressive sales presentations or company size. The person who will configure your workflows, build your integrations, and solve your technical challenges is the one who determines your success. Make sure you're evaluating the right people and that they'll be directly involved throughout your project.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Value Hands-On Expertise</strong> over organizational credentials. In the HubSpot ecosystem, deep platform experience and integration knowledge often matter more than company size or marketing polish. Look for experts who have consistently worked with HubSpot, understand its evolution, and can demonstrate genuine expertise through specific examples and case studies.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider Business Acumen</strong> alongside technical skills. The best HubSpot experts understand that technology serves business objectives, not the other way around. They should ask probing questions about your business model, processes, and goals before recommending technical solutions. Technical competence without business understanding often leads to elegant solutions that don't solve real problems.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Challenge the Safety Mindset</strong> that defaults to large agencies or well-known names. Today's business environment rewards outcomes over organizational size. The most successful HubSpot implementations often come from working directly with experienced practitioners who take personal responsibility for your results rather than managing them through layers of account handlers.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Prioritize Integration Capabilities</strong> if your business relies on multiple software systems. The ability to create seamless connections between HubSpot and your existing tools often determines whether your implementation enhances or complicates your operations. Integration expertise has become increasingly valuable as businesses rely on more sophisticated technology stacks.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Invest in the Relationship</strong> rather than just the project. The best HubSpot experts become trusted advisors who help you adapt and optimize your system as your business grows. Look for someone who thinks beyond the initial implementation to your long-term success and evolution.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Trust Your Evaluation Process</strong> rather than rushing to a decision based on pressure or convenience. The systematic approach outlined in this guide might seem thorough, but the time invested in proper evaluation pays dividends through better outcomes and fewer problems down the road.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Remember that your goal isn't just implementing HubSpotâ€”it's transforming your business processes to drive growth, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experiences. The right expert will understand this bigger picture and partner with you to achieve meaningful business outcomes rather than just technical deliverables.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Take the time to find someone who combines technical excellence with strategic thinking, clear communication, and genuine commitment to your success. The investment in finding the right expert will pay off through faster implementation, better results, and a HubSpot system that truly serves your business objectives.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Your HubSpot implementation can be a catalyst for significant business growth and operational improvement. With the right expert partnership, you'll not only get a well-configured system but also gain valuable insights into how to leverage technology more effectively across your entire business.</p>
