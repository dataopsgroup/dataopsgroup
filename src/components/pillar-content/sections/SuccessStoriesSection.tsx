      <h3>SaaS Company Integration Transformation</h3>
      
      <p>
        This B2B SaaS platform with 50 employees was struggling with disconnected systems that created data silos and required significant manual work. Their previous state involved using Salesforce for sales, Intercom for support, and Stripe for billing, but with no integration between systems.
      </p>
      
      <KeyInsightCallout title="The Challenge">
        <p>
          Manual data entry between systems, no unified view of the customer journey, impossible marketing attribution tracking, 
          and over 15 hours weekly spent on manual data management.
        </p>
      </KeyInsightCallout>
      
      <p>
        The HubSpot expert they hired conducted a comprehensive audit of existing systems and data flows, then created a strategic migration plan that prioritized business continuity. The solution included custom API integrations between HubSpot, Stripe, and their internal systems.
      </p>
      
      <h4>The Technical Implementation</h4>
      
      <p>
        The 8-week phased implementation ensured working integrations at each stage with zero data loss during migration. Custom webhook development enabled real-time updates, while advanced lead scoring incorporated both behavioral and billing data.
      </p>

      <h3>Manufacturing Company Digital Transformation</h3>
      
      <p>
        This industrial equipment manufacturer was limited by paper-based processes and disconnected systems that prevented growth scaling. Before the implementation, their quote-to-cash process took 3-4 weeks with no visibility into sales pipeline or forecasting.
