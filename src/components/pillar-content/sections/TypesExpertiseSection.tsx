      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Types of HubSpot Expertise and Specializations</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">HubSpot's comprehensive platform requires different types of specialized knowledge, and understanding these specializations helps you target the right expertise for your specific needs.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Marketing Hub Specialists</strong> focus on the demand generation side of your business. They excel at lead generation and conversion optimization, email marketing campaigns, and marketing automation workflows. If your primary goal is to improve how you attract and nurture prospects, a Marketing Hub specialist will understand the nuances of campaign analytics, attribution modeling, and landing page optimization.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Sales Hub Experts</strong> concentrate on accelerating your sales process and improving deal closure rates. They specialize in sales pipeline configuration, deal management, and sales automation. These experts understand how to set up effective sales sequences, optimize quote and proposal processes, and create reporting that actually helps sales managers coach their teams effectively.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>HubSpot Integration Specialists</strong> have become increasingly valuable as businesses rely on more connected systems. These experts understand how to make HubSpot work seamlessly with your existing toolsâ€”whether that's connecting your accounting software, e-commerce platform, or custom business applications. They're skilled in API integrations, Zapier automation workflows, and ensuring clean data flow between systems. Given that most businesses now use 5-10 different software tools, integration expertise can be the difference between a smooth, automated workflow and a collection of disconnected systems requiring manual work.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Revenue Operations (RevOps) Experts</strong> take a holistic approach to aligning your marketing, sales, and service operations. They focus on breaking down silos between departments and creating unified processes that support your entire customer lifecycle. RevOps specialists are particularly valuable for growing businesses that need to scale their operations efficiently.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>CMS Hub Developers</strong> specialize in website development within HubSpot's content management system. They handle custom theme development, SEO optimization, and advanced functionality that goes beyond standard templates. If your website is a critical part of your HubSpot strategy, a CMS Hub developer can create the technical foundation that supports your broader marketing and sales goals.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">The key is matching the specialist's expertise to your primary objectives. If you're implementing multiple Hubs or need complex integrations, look for someone with broad platform knowledge rather than just specialization in one area.</p>
