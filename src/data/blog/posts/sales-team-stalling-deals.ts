    <p>"Our reps aren't closing enough deals." I hear this complaint from nearly every CRO I work with, yet the data tells a very different story.</p>
    
    <p>According to Gartner's B2B Buying Journey Report, the problem isn't your sales team's ability—it's that the buying process has fundamentally transformed while your sales approach remains unchanged.</p>
    
    <p>Consider this shocking statistic: B2B buyers now spend only 17% of their purchase journey talking to potential suppliers. The remaining 83% happens entirely without your sales team's involvement—through independent research, peer discussions, and internal deliberations.</p>
    
    <p>Even more concerning, Forrester Research found that the average B2B purchase decision now involves 6-10 decision makers, each bringing 4-5 pieces of information to the table. That's potentially 50 different inputs your sales rep needs to address—often without direct access to every stakeholder.</p>
    
    <p>This expanded buying committee creates what CEB/Gartner calls "the consensus gap," where individual stakeholders may support your solution but struggle to build collective agreement. Their research shows that 94% of buying committees experience these consensus challenges, extending sales cycles by an average of 1.6 months.</p>
    
    <p>The most successful sales organizations aren't pressuring reps to "close harder"—they're reimagining how they support the buyer's journey. McKinsey found that companies enabling "consensus buying" outperform competitors by providing:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Stakeholder-specific content addressing each role's priorities</li>
      <li>Internal business case creation tools for champions</li>
      <li>Digital buying platforms that persist without sales involvement</li>
      <li>Asynchronous communication options beyond meetings and calls</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Use Customer Journey Analysis to go beyond traditional pipeline metrics to map these complex buying journeys. Our approach identifies engagement across all stakeholders, reveals content consumption patterns, and highlights opportunities to facilitate internal consensus building.</p>
