    <p>"Our churn rate is 15%." Ouch.</p>
    
    <p>When I ask executives how they calculate this figure, nearly all reveal they're only measuring logo churn—completely missing the revenue impact of downgrades, scope reductions, and underutilized services.</p>
    
    <p>ProfitWell's Retention Analysis found that the average B2B company's revenue churn exceeds their logo churn by 38%, creating a massive blindspot in growth projections.</p>
    
    <p>This oversight is costly. According to Bain & Company, a mere 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits by 25% to 95%. Yet Forrester discovered that only 18% of companies have a comprehensive retention program with clear visibility into churn risk factors.</p>
    
    <p>The true picture of customer health requires measuring multiple dimensions:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Logo retention</strong>: Are customers staying or leaving entirely?</li>
      <li><strong>Revenue retention</strong>: Is contract value growing, shrinking, or staying flat?</li>
      <li><strong>Product utilization</strong>: Are customers actively using what they've purchased?</li>
      <li><strong>Net Promoter Score</strong>: Would customers recommend you to others?</li>
      <li><strong>Expansion potential</strong>: Could existing customers buy more from you?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Gainsight's Customer Success Study revealed that companies tracking all five dimensions achieve net revenue retention rates of 120%+ (meaning they grow by 20% annually even without new logos), while those tracking only logo churn average just 92% (meaning they shrink by 8% annually despite retention efforts).</p>
    
    <p>Even more concerning, HubSpot Research found that 80% of customers who leave do so without ever registering a formal complaint—they simply don't renew. The warning signs were present in their engagement data, but most companies lacked the systems to monitor and respond to these signals.</p>
    
    <p>Having a Customer Churn Rate Report helps you see past basic metrics to provide a comprehensive view of customer health across all these dimensions. Our approach integrates product usage data, service interactions, financial trends, and satisfaction scores to identify at-risk accounts before they consider leaving.</p>
