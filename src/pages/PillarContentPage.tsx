        <p className="mb-4">Finding the right HubSpot expert can be the difference between simply using another marketing tool and unleashing a growth engine that transforms your entire business. If you've been struggling with disconnected systems, manual processes, or a HubSpot setup that feels more complicated than helpful, you're not alone.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">The challenge isn't just about implementing HubSpot anymore. With thousands of integrations now available and countless ways to configure the platform, the real question has become: how do you find someone who understands both the technical possibilities and your specific business needs?</p>

        <p className="mb-4">Here's what makes this decision particularly tricky in 2025. Many businesses assume they need a big agency because that feels "safer," but the reality is often quite different. You might meet with impressive senior consultants during the sales process, only to have your actual work handled by junior team members who lack the business experience to make strategic decisions. Meanwhile, some of the most skilled HubSpot experts work independently, bringing years of hands-on experience directly to your project.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">The integration landscape has become especially complex. Your HubSpot implementation isn't just about marketing automation anymoreâ€”it needs to talk to your CRM, your accounting software, your e-commerce platform, and whatever other tools keep your business running. Getting these connections right from the start can save you months of frustration and thousands of dollars in rework.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">Throughout this guide, you'll discover how to identify genuine expertise, avoid common hiring mistakes, and find someone who can turn HubSpot into the business asset you originally envisioned. Whether you're implementing HubSpot for the first time, fixing a problematic setup, or expanding into new areas of the platform, the insights here will help you make a decision you'll feel confident about long after the project is complete.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">Most importantly, you'll learn to focus on outcomes rather than company size, and to ask the right questions that reveal whether someone truly understands how to make HubSpot work for businesses like yours.</p>
