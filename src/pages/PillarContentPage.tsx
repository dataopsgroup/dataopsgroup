                  <p className="mb-4">Finding the right HubSpot expert can be the difference between simply using another marketing tool and unleashing a growth engine that transforms your entire business. If you've been struggling with disconnected systems, manual processes, or a HubSpot setup that feels more complicated than helpful, you're not alone.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mb-4">The challenge isn't just about implementing HubSpot anymore. With thousands of integrations now available and countless ways to configure the platform, the real question has become: how do you find someone who understands both the technical possibilities and your specific business needs?</p>
                  
                  <p className="mb-4">Here's what makes this decision particularly tricky in 2025. Many businesses assume they need a big agency because that feels "safer," but the reality is often quite different. You might meet with impressive senior consultants during the sales process, only to have your actual work handled by junior team members who lack the business experience to make strategic decisions. Meanwhile, some of the most skilled HubSpot experts work independently, bringing years of hands-on experience directly to your project.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mb-4">The integration landscape has become especially complex. Your HubSpot implementation isn't just about marketing automation anymoreâ€”it needs to talk to your CRM, your accounting software, your e-commerce platform, and whatever other tools keep your business running. Getting these connections right from the start can save you months of frustration and thousands of dollars in rework.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mb-4">Throughout this guide, you'll discover how to identify genuine expertise, avoid common hiring mistakes, and find someone who can turn HubSpot into the business asset you originally envisioned. Whether you're implementing HubSpot for the first time, fixing a problematic setup, or expanding into new areas of the platform, the insights here will help you make a decision you'll feel confident about long after the project is complete.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mb-4">Most importantly, you'll learn to focus on outcomes rather than company size, and to ask the right questions that reveal whether someone truly understands how to make HubSpot work for businesses like yours.</p>
                </section>
              )}

                <section id="understanding-experts" className="p-4" tabIndex={-1}>
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding HubSpot Experts vs Consultants vs Agencies</h2>

                  <p className="mb-4">The HubSpot ecosystem includes different types of professionals, and understanding these distinctions will help you make the right choice for your specific needs.</p>

                  <p className="mb-4"><strong>Independent HubSpot Experts</strong> work directly with you throughout your entire project. They typically have deep, hands-on experience with multiple HubSpot Hubs and integrations, often bringing 3+ years of intensive platform experience across various business types. What sets them apart is their combination of technical skills and business acumenâ€”they understand not just how to configure HubSpot, but why certain configurations make sense for your business goals.</p>

                  <p className="mb-4">The biggest advantage of working with an independent expert is continuity. The person you meet during the sales process is the same person who will implement your solution and provide ongoing support. This eliminates the knowledge transfer gaps that often plague larger implementations.</p>

                  <p className="mb-4"><strong>HubSpot Marketing Agencies</strong> operate quite differently. They're typically structured around account management, with senior staff handling sales conversations while junior team members often handle the actual implementation work. This isn't necessarily problematic, but it's important to understand the structure before you commit.</p>

                  <p className="mb-4">Many agencies use standardized processes and templated approaches, which can be efficient but may not address your unique business requirements. They also have higher overhead costs that get reflected in their pricing, and some agencies actually outsource HubSpot work to subcontractors or offshore teams despite presenting themselves as having in-house expertise.</p>

                  <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Experience Gap Reality</strong> is something many businesses don't consider until it's too late. You might be impressed by an agency's senior consultants during the sales process, only to discover that your day-to-day work will be handled by someone with much less experience. This is particularly problematic for complex integrations, where business context and technical expertise need to work together.</p>

                  <p className="mb-4">The most successful HubSpot implementations typically come from working directly with experienced practitioners who understand both the platform's capabilities and your business challenges. When you're evaluating options, focus on who will actually be doing the work, not just who's making the sales presentation.</p>
