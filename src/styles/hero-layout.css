/* Hero Layout Comments and Documentation - Maintains Original File Structure */

/* 
FLEXIBLE LAYOUT PROTECTION COMMENTS:
- Gray hero box now uses clamp() for responsive scaling (450px-700px)
- Grid system uses flexible columns that scale with viewport
- Woman's background image repositioned to 85% to create more left space
- Z-index hierarchy: background (5) < content box (20) < button (25)
- mt-12 class on Trusted Companies section provides proper spacing below hero
- bg-gray-50 from React component creates seamless background (no CSS gradient override)
- RESPONSIVE RULE: Gray box flexes appropriately on laptop vs desktop screens
- POSITIONING RULE: Woman repositioned from 75% to 85% for better space utilization
- SCALING RULE: Content scales gracefully from 450px (laptop) to 700px (large desktop)
- OVERLAP PREVENTION: Flexible sizing maintains safe distance from woman consultant image
